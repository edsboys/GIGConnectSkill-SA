# GIGConnectSkill SA - FNB App of the Year Hackathon

## 1. Project Overview

GIGConnectSkill SA is a mobile-first digital marketplace designed to connect South Africaâ€™s informal workers with potential clients. The platform aims to formalize the informal sector by providing a trusted environment for job postings, worker verification, and secure digital payments.

This prototype was developed for the FNB App of the Year Hackathon.

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication and Firestore)
- **UI**: React Native Paper

## 3. Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd GIGConnectSkillSA
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase:**
    - Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Enable Email/Password authentication in the "Authentication" section.
    - Create a Firestore database.
    - Copy your Firebase project's configuration object into `firebaseConfig.js`.

4.  **Seed the database (Important!):**
    - **Step 4.1: Add Credentials:** Open the `seed.js` file and replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object with your actual Firebase project configuration.
    - **Step 4.2: Temporarily Adjust Security Rules:** By default, your Firestore database is secure and will not allow scripts to write data. To run the seed script, you must temporarily relax these rules.
        - Go to your Firebase project console -> Firestore Database -> Rules.
        - Change the rule from `allow read, write: if request.auth != null;` to:
          ```
          rules_version = '2';
          service cloud.firestore {
            match /databases/{database}/documents {
              match /{document=**} {
                // Allow read and write access for a short period to seed data
                allow read, write: if true;
              }
            }
          }
          ```
        - **Publish** the new rules.
    - **Step 4.3: Run the Script:**
      ```bash
      node seed.js
      ```
    - **Step 4.4: Secure Your Database Again!** After the script runs successfully, **immediately** change the rules back to the default to protect your database:
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        - **Publish** the secure rules.

5.  **Run the app:**
    - Start the Expo development server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
    - Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and run the app.
